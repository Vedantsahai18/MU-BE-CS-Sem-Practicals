Experiment 8
Task 1
1. Write a block to display sum of digits of a three-digit number
Code :(Using PL/SQL)
do $$
<<block1>>
Declare
	n int:=534;
	n1 int;n2 int;n3 int;ans int;
Begin
	n1=n/100;
	n2=(n/10)%10;
	n3=n%10;
	ans=n1+n2+n3;
	Raise Notice 'SUM OF 3 DIGITS OF A 3 DIGIT NUMBER IS=% ',ans;
end block1 $$;

Output :
NOTICE:  SUM OF 3 DIGITS OF A 3 DIGIT NUMBER IS=12
Query returned successfully with no result in 12 ms.

2. Write a block to display square of 1 to 10
Code :(Using PL/SQL)
do $$
<<block2>>
Declare
	n int:=1;
Begin
	while n<=10
	loop
		Raise Notice 'SQUARE OF % number =% ',n,(n*n);
		n:=n+1;
	end loop;
end block2 $$;

Output :
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 1 number =1
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 2 number =4
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 3 number =9
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 4 number =16
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 5 number =25
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 6 number =36
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 7 number =49
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 8 number =64
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 9 number =81
NOTICE:  SQUARE OF 10 number =100

3. Write a block to display Fibonacci series upto 8th term (start with 0,1)
Code:
do $$
<<bl>>
declare
	count int: =3; f int; s int; t int;
begin
	f=0;
	s=1;
	Raise Notice 'The Term 1 of Fibonacci series is %',f;
	Raise Notice 'The Term 2 of Fibonacci series is %',s;
	t=f+s;
	Raise Notice 'The Term % of Fibonacci series is %',count,t;
	count=count+1;
	while count<=8
	loop
		f=s;
		s=t;
		t=f+s;
		Raise Notice 'The Term % of Fibonacci series is %',count,t;
		count:=count+1;
	end loop;
end bl $$;

Output :
NOTICE:  The Term 1 of Fibonacci series is 0
NOTICE:  The Term 2 of Fibonacci series is 1
NOTICE:  The Term 3 of Fibonacci series is 1
NOTICE:  The Term 4 of Fibonacci series is 2
NOTICE:  The Term 5 of Fibonacci series is 3
NOTICE:  The Term 6 of Fibonacci series is 5
NOTICE:  The Term 7 of Fibonacci series is 8
NOTICE:  The Term 8 of Fibonacci series is 13
